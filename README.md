# tb-bulk-rnaseq
Bulk RNA‑seq analysis of tuberculosis cohort GSE107994 using R and Quarto.

This is a personal project to get acquainted with bulk RNA-Seq data in relation to human disease.
The R code for managing and analyzing the data will be stored and discussed within a Quarto document (.qmd) to serve as a walkthrough.
